    I'm a first-year BTech student with a strong passion for technology and coding. Currently, I specialize in frontend web development—transforming design ideas into dynamic, interactive web experiences. As I progress in my studies, I'm working toward becoming a full-stack developer, aiming to integrate both frontend and backend technologies to build complete, efficient solutions.

Alongside my development work, I’m dedicated to honing my coding skills and enhancing my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms using C++. This commitment helps me develop robust problem-solving abilities that are essential for tackling complex challenges in the tech world.

My journey is just beginning, but I’m excited to leverage my foundational skills and academic experiences to contribute to innovative projects and continuously evolve as a developer.
